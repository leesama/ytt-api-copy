![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Project Introduction

ytt-api-copy is a Tampermonkey plugin that integrates with the yapi-to-typescript tool. yapi-to-typescript is a powerful tool used to convert yapi interface data into TypeScript type declaration files. With this Tampermonkey plugin, you can easily copy the request function name, the corresponding React Hook name, the parameter type name, and the return value type name while viewing the yapi interface. This significantly boosts frontend development efficiency.

## Tampermonkey Plugin Features

- **Copy Request Function Name:** Click the plugin button on the yapi page to automatically copy the name of the current request function, making it convenient to use directly in your project.

- **Copy Requested React Hook Name:** For projects using React Hook, the plugin can copy the name of the current request's corresponding React Hook, simplifying code writing.

- **Copy Request Parameter Type Name:** Quickly copy the name of the current request's parameter type, saving you the effort of manual lookup and definition.

- **Copy Request Parameter Return Value Name:** Similarly, the plugin can copy the name of the current request's return value type, reducing the need for manual type definition maintenance.

## How to Use

1. First, make sure you have installed Tampermonkey or any other browser extension that supports Tampermonkey plugins.

2. Download and install this Tampermonkey plugin.

3. Open the yapi page and go to the interface you want to view.

4. Click the plugin button and choose to copy the request function name, React Hook name, parameter type name, or return value type name as needed.

5. Paste the copied content into your code and import the types or functions generated by yapi-to-typescript using your IDE's code completion capabilities.

## yapi-to-typescript Configuration

Before using yapi-to-typescript to generate types and request functions, you must add the following configuration to the yapi-to-typescript configuration file:

```javascript
getRequestFunctionName(interfaceInfo, changeCase) {
  return changeCase.camelCase(
    `api${interfaceInfo.method}${interfaceInfo.path}`
  );
}
```

The types and function names generated by yapi-to-typescript must match those copied by ytt-api-copy.
